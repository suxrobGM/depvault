# End-to-End Encryption

All files (`RepoFile`, both `kind`s) are encrypted client-side and stored as one ciphertext blob per file. The server stores only ciphertext and never decrypts.

## Key Hierarchy

```text
Vault Password (user-memorized, never sent to server)
  → PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iterations) → KEK (Key Encryption Key)
    → wraps ECDH P-256 private key (team sharing)
    → wraps recovery key (stored in UserVault)
    → wraps per-project DEKs via SELF grants
      → AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt of secrets

Recovery Key (random 256-bit, shown once at vault setup)
  → wrapped by KEK, stored in UserVault
  → independently wraps each project DEK via RECOVERY grants
  → used to restore vault access when password is forgotten
```

## Data Flows

- **Repo files**: client encrypts whole file → sends base64 `{encryptedContent, iv, authTag}` + `kind` → backend stores blob as-is (no variable parsing). Each push/save snapshots a `RepoFileVersion`
- **Share links**: ephemeral key, passed in URL fragment (`#key=`), never reaches the server
- **CI tokens**: DEK wrapped with an HKDF-derived key from the token; CLI/CI unwraps and decrypts locally
- **Team sharing**: ECDH P-256 agreement → granter wraps DEK with shared secret → recipient unwraps
- **Recovery**: recovery key unwraps all RECOVERY grants → re-wraps DEKs under new KEK
- **Password change**: re-wraps all SELF grants (DEKs + private key + recovery key) under new KEK

## Security Rules

- Backend must **never** encrypt or decrypt user secrets
- Vault password never leaves the client; KEK derived locally via PBKDF2
- Project DEKs wrapped per-user: SELF grant (KEK), RECOVERY grant (recovery key), or ECDH grant (shared secret)
- Recovery key is wrapped with KEK and stored in UserVault — never stored in plaintext
- One-time share links use ephemeral keys in URL fragments; the server never sees the decryption key
- Never log decrypted secret values
